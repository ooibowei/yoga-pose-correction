## Data Augmentation

To improve the training set, we augmented the keypoints using the following:
- Add small random noise (jitter) between x and x
- Random rotation around center between x and x
- Random scaling between x and x
- Random translation between x and x
- Random dropout (simulate missing landmarks)
